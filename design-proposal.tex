\section{Executive Summary}
\subsection{The Problem}
The state of today’s roads is dire. The failure of the UBER automated vehicle
program has left passengers stranded, abandoned and worse, run over.
\subsection{Our Solution}
Our objective is to solve this problem, by efficiently picking up all stranded
passengers. The “Das Pan” will feature a sweeping arm that pushes
passengers into our “pans”, a holding area, where they will stay for the
duration of their ride.
\subsubsection{Design Specifications}
The Das Pan, at a weight $\approx$ 8lb consists of three main modules. 

\paragraph{Arms}The arms, supported by a beam of height ?, have a length of ?,
and sweep in a unidirectional fashion in such a way that they are able to push
the passenger into the pans, whcih have dimensions ? x ?.

\paragraph{Body} The body, which consists of a base for the arms, wheel wells
for the ? diameter wheels and a housing for the circuits, is the central
portion of our design. On both the left and right side of the body, we have two
large ? x ? pans for holding passengers.

\paragraph{Electronics}The electronics, which consists of a series of sensors, actuators, and a central microprocessor.  

\subsubsection{Target Performance}
Our final Prototype will be able to navigate the roads in an intelligent
Fashion, seeking out passengers by using the information it has at hand. In our
final mechanism, Das Pan should be able to complete a passenger retrieval action
in less than 10 seconds. 

\section{Preface}
\par Work for this proposal was divided among our team using an excel
spreadsheet. We began outlining the subsections of our report, using the outline
provided in lectures. Subsections were defined from all pertinent information.\\

Once we defined subsections, as a team, we determined which member would be
most knowledgeable about specific subject, and assigned them to the task.\\

All sections began by creating a set of figures and tables. We shared these
tables and figures with one another, and provided feedback, continually making
modifications until all members were satisfied with the result.\\

Throughout this process, we sought out the help of our mentors and instructors,
namely Pam <insert last name here>, Jon Nakane, and Bernhard Zender, who guided
us in the formatting and the technical writing of this document. 

\section{Overview of Basic Strategy}
\par Our objective is to create a simple yet effective robot. We believe that a
plain and straightforward design is a successful design.
\subsection{Mechanical Overview}
\par Precision plays a vital role in traditional passenger retrieval. We sought
to engineering out precision.  We came up with a broom and dust-pan design.  Our
arm will sweep passengers off their podium and drag them into our dust-pans. 
This does not require the precision of other candidate mechanism such as
forklifts, since the broom can span a wide range. This also avoids destroying
houses since the bristles of the broom will be elastic and will deform around
rigid structures. 
\subsection{Electrical Overview}
\par We plan on modularizing our electrical circuits such that each circuit that
performs an atomic function (ex. H-Bridge, IR detect) is on its own board.  We
think that an encapsulated and modularized circuit design will allow us to
individually test components.  Such components are also easily replaceable.
\subsection{Software Overview}
\par We will store a graph representation of the playing surface in memory for
decision making during navigation. Each node signifies an intersection on the
surface, and each edge represents a path. We will use dynamic weights to decide
which path to take.  The weights depend on the likelihood of a passenger being
in an edge, the presence of a passenger at an edge, and the path to the drop off
area.  We will adjust weights as we pick up a passenger so the weight of the
edge from which we picked up the passenger is decreased, and the weights of the
edges toward the drop off are increased.  This means that once we are at
capacity, the weights will make it more favourable for the robot to navigate to
the drop off area rather than pick up another passenger.\\

Storing the surface in memory allows for smarter decision making and will reduce
our dependency on detecting IR signals to find the drop off area.

\subsection{Redesign Potential and Flexibility}
Where is this?
\subsection{Estimated Final Specifications}
Where is this also?
\section{Drive and Actuator System}
\par There are 8 actuators total in our design: a pair of geared Coleman motors to power the wheels (bidirectional), a pair of geared Coleman motors to move the arms (unidirectional), a pair of un-geared Coleman motors to power the pusher winches (bidirectional) and a pair of servo motors to lock the pushers in place. \\
\subsection{Drive Mechanism and Transmission}
\par There are two powered wheels, which are controlled independently to allow for tape following, turning and driving in reverse. In addition, there is an unpowered ball-and-socket roller to provide a third point of contact. To maximize control in tape following, the wheels were placed on the very back end of the chassis. To maximize torque while turning, the wheels were placed with the largest possible distance between them (12''). The roller was placed at the very front of the robot, along the centerline, to maximize its distance from the driving wheels and improve stability. \\ \par 
The placement of the wheels, drive motors and transmission is illustrated below: \\
//TODO: INSERT DIAGRAM + CALULATION \\
\par Therefore, in order to accelerate the robot at a maximum acceleration of ${0.5 \frac{m}{s^2}}$, the drive motors must exert a torque of \_\_\_. This will consume \_\_\_ W of power. To maintain constant velocity, the motors must exert a torque of \_\_\_. This will consume \_\_\_ W of power. \\
\subsection{Steering}
\par The robot's pair or arms and passenger-collection pans
allows it pickup and drop off passengers to either side without turning away
from the tape line in the path's center. In addition, the robot will be able to drive in reverse, allowing it to enter and exit dead-end streets without needing to turn. Because of this, the robot will never need to turn under any circumstances other than at intersections in the path. \\ \par Therefore, in order to make a turn, the robot must be able to detect an intersection, right itself onto the correct tape line once the turn is complete, and be mechanically capable of turning itself. To detect the intersection, the robot will read the output of branch-detection QRDs placed near the front right and front left corners of the chassis. To right itself, it will rely on the normal tape-following QRDs. \\ \par The turning mechanism is illustrated below: \\
//TODO: INSERT DIAGRAM + CALCULATIONS \\
\par Therefore, in order to begin turning and maintain a constant angular speed,  the motors must exert a torque of \_\_\_. This will consume \_\_\_ W of power. \\ \par 
Considering this and the previous constraints on torque calculated for driving and accelerating, the gear ratio should be approximately \_\_\_. \\
\subsection{Arm Mechanism}
\par The left and right sides of the robot both have an identical arm, so that passengers can be retrieved from either direction without changing the yaw of the arm. The arm is jointed and ends in a brush (made of rubber tines or fibres strong enough to push a passenger but flexible enough to give way when brought against a building or curb). The joint of the arm are designed so that, with a single rotation of the large, arm-supporting gears, the brush will trace out a horizontal path (allowing it to â€œsweepâ€� passengers into the pans). \\ \par 
\par This mechanism is illustrated below: \\
//TODO: INSERT DIAGRAM + CALCULATIONS \\
\par Therefore, in order to move the arm through 1 complete cycle in 5 seconds (unobstructed by objects in path of brush), the motor must exert a maximum torque of \_\_\_.
\subsection{Pan Mechanism}
\par The left and right sides of the robot both have identical pans, which consist of a lightweight surface of sheet metal attached to the chassis by a narrow rubber strip. The pan also has a winch-powered pusher and pulley mechanism to expel passengers at the drop-off zone by pushing them out of the pans. In addition, if the pusher strip is held in place by a locking servo, the winches will instead pull the pans up slightly, pulling them off the ground to reduce friction and ensure that passengers don't fall out during transport. \\ \par 
This mechanism is illustrated below: (the pans are simple and required few calculation beyond basic size) \\
//TODO: INSERT DIAGRAM + CALCULATIONS \\

\section{Strategy, Algorithms and Software}
\subsection{Tape Following and Navigation}
\subsubsection{Machine State}
There are two main states that our robot will inhabit for most of the duration
of the competition - roam search empty, and roam search full - with the main
difference between the two being the absence and presence of a passenger
respectively.\\

When in roam search empty, which is the starting state of the robot, the robot
will wander the playing field in search of a passenger using pre assigned
weights for each path.  Once a passenger is detected, the robot will attempt to
pick up the passenger.  If the attempt is successful the robot will go to roam
search full state.\\

Every time a passenger is picked up, the weight of the path from which the
passenger was picked will be reduced and weights leading to the drop off area
will be increased.  In roam search full, the robot will still be able to detect
passengers and pick them up.\\

Eventually, with enough passengers, it will be more favourable for the robot to
go to the drop off area.  The weights of the path will reflect this since the
weights of the paths on the playing fields are adjusted each time a passenger is
picked.  Since our robot will have passengers on both sides, it is possible that
the robot is still full after the drop off operation.  At this state, the robot
will return to roam search full.  If the robot is empty it will return to roam
search empty.\\

In the last 30 seconds of the competition, if the robot is in roam search full
state, weights will also be adjusted to favour the drop off area.  While in roam
search empty the weights of the paths reflect the probability of a passenger, in
roam search full they also represent the urgency of a drop off - whether due to
capacity or due to time.\\

At any time, if the robot senses that a collision is eminent, it will stop its
operation and attempt to navigate away from the collision.\\

Please refer to the state diagram below for a summary.

\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{robot-state-diagram}
We will use PID control to follow the tape on the playing surface.  We will
finely tune the proportional, integral, and differential error gains with much
data and experimentation.

\subsubsection{Graph Based Navigation}
We plan on storing a discrete graph representation of the playing surface in
memory on the TINAH.  Each intersection on the playing surface will be a node,
and each path between the intersections will be an edge.  The graph will be
weighted, but not directional.  The weights of the graph will characterize the
likelihood of a passenger being on a certain edge.\\
\includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{map}
\newline
The weights of the graph will also be dynamic, changing based on the state of
the robot.  The initial weights will be based on the number of possible
locations for a passenger.  Once we pick up a passenger from a certain edge, the
weight for the edge will decrease.  If we the robot has a passenger, the weights
for the edges in the shortest path to the destination will be increased.  The
weights will also be ignored if the robot senses a passenger’s beacon at some
edge.\\
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale = 0.4]{graph}
\newline
\end{center}
By storing the playing surface in memory, we hope to reduce the robot’s
dependency on IR signals for self-location and navigation.  Storing the playing
surface is also advantageous in making decisions based on history and location.
\subsection{Passenger Detection}
The robot will use IR signals to detect passengers.  As mentioned before, if a
passenger is detected at any time, the weights of the graph will be ignored and
the robot will attempt to pick up the passenger.
\subsection{Collision Detection}
If the robot detects a collision, it will escape whatever state it is in and
attempt to navigate away from the collision.

\section{Risk Assessment and Contingency Planning}
\subsection{Risk Assessment}

\begin{longtable}{| L{7em} | L{7em} | L{7em} | L{7em} | L{6em} |}
\hline 
Risk Condition & Probability of Occurrence & Impact to Project & Change to Work Plan & Expected Date of Risk Decision \\
\hline
Robot get’s lost in map due to failure to detect the presence of an intersection
& (Based on Jon’s expertise) Unlikely to occur so long as speed is kept within a
reasonable range & Robot will be unable to return passengers to base during the
competition & Create a structure that reaches the height of the destination
beacon and & Week two of robot construction \\
\hline
During the competition a passenger falls out of its containment area during
turning or otherwise& Dependant on the rigidity and geometry of container &
Robot will loose the current passenger, but will be able to continue thereafter.
& Minor Problem - increase side wall length

Major Problem \newline - further increase the walls of the containment area
while redesigning the arm to ensure the passengers can land in this modified
container & Week 2 of robot construction\\
\hline
During collision on competition day the extruding flaps in our design are more
likely to be damaged than the chassis. If the flaps are damaged during a
collision, the robot’s passenger containment mechanism could be compromised & It
is likely that during a collision, these low-hanging flaps will be impacted,
however, by using stronger materials, and ensuring the flaps have reliable
fixtures joining them to the main chassis we can mitigate this risk.& Minor
damage will likely cause little impact on the robot's functionality, except for
perhaps decreasing the integrity of the passenger containment area, and thus
increasing the risk of passenger loss &Increase the number of collision sensors
to prevent collisions in the first place & Final week of robot construction \\
\hline
Risk that the maximum reach of the arm will limit our capacity to pick up
passengers when they are far away & Depending on the geometry of the track and
placement of the passengers.& Inability to retrieve passengers located too far
from the midline of the track & Changing the arm’s length and range of motion.
This will be made easy due to the arm’s modular design & Decision will be made
once track has been finalized\\
\hline 
Risk of catching or stalling the arm on obstacles or buildings when operating&
Very unlikely because the arm only operates when the robot is stationary, and
the brush is designed to give way to obstacles.& Most likely temporary
disruption of the arm’s or robot’s motion, possibly moderate damage to the arm.
&Changes to the flexibility of the brush or design and range of motion to avoid
future catching & Decision can be made once design is finalized while testing
robot on track.\\
\hline
Risk that the arm’s sweep knocks the passenger away from the arm’s reach, fails
to push it all the way to the pan, or fails to push it over the pan’s edge &
Probably unlikely given the arm’s motion shouldn’t allow this. It is difficult
to say without testing&Failure to retrieve the passenger, possibly knocking it
into the path or off the arena& Change the structure of the brush and motion of
the arm. If necessary, add more degrees of freedom to the arm & During the
testing and development of the arm over the next few weeks\\
\hline
\end{longtable}

\subsection{Mitigation and Contingency Planning}
In order to prevent our robot from getting lost, due to it’s lack of a
destination beacon detector, we will ensure that we have a large safety factor
on our tape IR detection. We will engineer our navigation systems such that it
can perfectly detect intersections while traveling at top speed. This will
greatly mitigate the risk of getting lost due to a failure of the intersection
detection mechanism. \\

Furthermore, if time permits, a beacon detector may be implemented in order to
verify the state of our robot’s navigation system.\\

We can mitigate the risk of losing passengers by ensuring that  we use a
material with a high coefficient of static friction for the surface of our
passenger containment area. \\

By improving our collision detection systems we can reduce the risk of damage
due to collision. Furthermore, by protruding the anterior and posterior portions
of our robot, we can ensure that they take the brunt of most impacts.\\

To mitigate the risk of a limitation due to arm length, we will ensure that our
design will be as modular as possible
